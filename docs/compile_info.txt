		             How to compile Odin?

To compile Odin you need to have GCC C Compiler. There are three diferent
types of compilation commands. The first one is 'make' this command should
make all 3 servers compile at a time. The other options are 'make a' to compile
Account Server only, 'make c' to compile Character Server only, and 'make z'
to compile Zone Server only. After you have tested the servers is with new
additions is recommendable that you do a 'make clean' command to remove old *.o
garbage and load new link object data to the compiler. By telling this I assume
that the GCC C Compiler is pointing to the folder where the source code is.
That is where the Makefile is in.

Special Note: There is a problem loading Zone Server if the variable located
at sys/types.h is not set to 5000. I'm talking of FD_SETSIZE; the default
value is 64 but the server wont work if this is not changed. So it should be
set to 5000 and not 64.
