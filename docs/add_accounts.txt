		      How to add players account to Odin?

=====================
   Using _M or _F
--------------------

The easy way to add players account in Odin is by leaving them to register
automatic by adding _M or _F at the end of their login name. But first you must
set the option in account_cfg.ini. Search for the line 'SecureMode' and turn it off. How?
By adding a zero after the =. If SecureMode is enable you cannot register by
using this method.

Example:

In account_cfg.ini:
SecureMode=0

In game client:
While in the login screen of the game client, write your username and then add _M for
male and _F for Female. 'username_M' will create a male account, 'username_F' will
create a female account. Then you setup your password normally by writting the one
you must like. The next time you log in you can use only 'username' without the _M or _F.


=====================
 Using addplayer.txt
---------------------

Where to find addplayer.txt? It is in save/accounts/addplayer.txt. To add a
player using this method is pretty easy, and the server will automatic add
the new account without turning them off. Beware, by adding a redundant
name, a name that already exits in the database, because it will delete
anything that is on the addplayer.txt and will not add absolutly nothing.
The format to add players using this method is as follows:
username, password, sex, email, playermode

Sex must be 0 or 1. 0 means female account, and 1 means male account.
playermode decide wheneter to add a normal player, gm player or sub gm player.
The values are 0 for normal account, 1 for sub gm account, 2 for gm accounts.
Save your changes and close the file. Go into game and log in, the server will
add the accounts in the exact time a player log in.
