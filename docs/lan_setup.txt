		     How to Setup an Internet Connection on Odin?

Fist of all you should know your WAN ip address, the ip address you 
use to connect to the internet. You can find it by entering in web
pages like www.whatismyip.com. Now after you know what is your ip address,
you can procced to setup Odin for the internet.

Take a look at Odin's config.ini. Look for:
AccountIP=127.0.0.1
CharacterIP=127.0.0.1
ZoneIP=127.0.0.1
InetIP=127.0.0.1
InetIPS=127.0.0.1
If you are hosting the servers on the same computer the only lines you have
to change are the last two. InetIP, and InetIPS are filled with your WAN
ip address. The rest can be leaved as default. But if in the other hand
you are setting multimap or character servers, you have to fill in every
line with your corresponding Internet addresses.


		Example of runnin the servers in diferent computers

Suppose we have 3 computers each with the corresponding ip addresses:
65.56.77.6
65.56.12.1
65.56.65.2

In the fist computer we set Account Server and we fill AccountIP with 65.56.77.6.
In the second computer we set Character Server and we will fill the
AccountIP with 65.56.77.6 and the CharacterIP with 65.56.12.1. Why? Because
you will have diferent config.ini, and because you are running the servers on
diferent computers and because Character Server must know the AccountIP to connect to it,
and the only way to get it is by filling it. And for the last one Zone
Server will be filled the same way Character Server do. CharacterIP must
be filled with 65.56.12.1 and ZoneIP with 65.56.65.2. No need to set Account
IP. Why? because of the same reason of above. Now to finnish setting the
network in the config.ini of where Character Server is hosted you fill
InetIP with the Character Server's ip, and InetIPS with the Zone Server ip.
Then in where the Zone Server is hosted you do the same. No need to add
it where Account Server is hosted. So it can be leaved as default.
