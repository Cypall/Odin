		      How to add administration accounts?

First of all, an administrator account is needed to process information between
servers. So that is the main reason of them. Actually the server cames with a
predifined administrator account nammed, srv with password admn. This should be
changed as hoster needs. Plus another big important usage of them is that you
can set up to 30 diferent Character Servers, and Zone Servers. Pretty useful if you
want to setup Odin in diferent computers. To add an administrator account you
must follow this format and without forget that you must add it into
save/accounts/accounts.txt:
1,srv,admn,S,NULL,18/12/2004 09:58:55,0,0,0,0,NULL,0,297	

The meanings of the terms are as follows in their respect order:
id, username, password, S means Server and always should be S so it can
be recognized as administration account, NULL, last access time, all the
leading zeros are least significant but are needed, NULL, 0, the times that
the server has logged in.

Now after you have set an administrator account you must open character_cfg.ini and
zone_cfg.ini and set:
ServerUsername=yourusername
ServerPassword=yourpassword


=====================
    Important
---------------------

If you are going to setup more than one server it is requiered that you add
diferent administrators accounts for each server. I explain, Character Server
and Zone Server use the same admninistrator password to login into Account Server
and make the servers to be acknowlegde. So if you set more than one Character Server
is requiered that for each Character Server you register a new administrator account.
If you have more than one Zone Server it is requiered too, that you setup new accounts
as well. There is a maximum of 30 accounts that the server supports. So that means you
can set up to 30 diferent Character Servers and Zone Servers at a time. The ids of 
the administrator accounts must be set from 1 to 31. No id must be repeated.
