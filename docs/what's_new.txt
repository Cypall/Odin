			  What's New to Odin CVS Version 1.8.0


There are a few changes that have been made. The first one and most important
affects developers. Its not recommended to call values that print to the screen
in the consoles. It is tested that it slow down other server process while doing
this. So a function that writes to a file seems more efficient. The new function
debug_output have one argument and a list of them. What it is mean is that works
like a printf, but it will write directly to a file and not to screen buffer.
